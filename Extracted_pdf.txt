Abstract
Tracking is inherent in and central to the gig economy. Platforms
track gig workers’ performance through metrics such as acceptance
rate and punctuality, while gig workers themselves engage in self-
tracking. Although prior research has extensively examined how
gig platforms track workers through metrics – with some studies
briefly acknowledging the phenomenon of self-tracking among
workers – there is a dearth of studies that explore how and why
gig workers track themselves. To address this, we conducted 25
semi-structured interviews, revealing how gig workers self-track to
manage accountabilities to themselves and external entities across
three identities: the holistic self, the entrepreneurial self, and the
platformized self. We connect our findings to neoliberalism, through
which we contextualize gig workers’ self-accountability and the
invisible labor of self-tracking. We further discuss how self-tracking
mitigates information and power asymmetries in gig work and offer
design implications to support gig workers’ multi-dimensional self-
tracking.

Tracking workers’ behavior and performance has been a longstand-
ing practice in various industries and economies [ 95,102]. This
practice has evolved with the rise of platformization where indus-
tries adopt digital platforms as core infrastructure for business and
services, accelerating labor and economic shifts [ 11]. This transfor-
mation is especially pronounced within the gig economy, where
platforms and algorithms play a central role in managing and moni-
toring workers [ 11,27]. Gig platforms leverage technology to track
various aspects of gig workers’ activities, including location and per-
formance metrics (e.g., acceptance rate, cancellation rate, customer
ratings) for control, safety, and customer satisfaction [ 75,111]. Re-
searchers have extensively studied these algorithms and metrics
due to their role in surveilling and monitoring the worker [ 13,56],
aligning with broader studies on workplace tracking that delve into
the implications of surveillance [3, 89].
There is a distinction between the external tracking done by gig
platforms and self-tracking for empowerment and self-knowledge.
While there is an abundance of research on platform metrics, only
some studies touch on gig workers’ self-tracking practices outside of
gig platforms. For instance, gig workers have been observed to self-
track as a form of protection from platforms and customers [ 75,99].
Additionally, gig workers self-track income, expenses, and mileage
to fulfill tax obligations given their classification as independent
contractors which requires them to calculate and file income and
self-employment taxes [ 83,106]. Researchers have recognized gig
workers’ self-tracking practices and what necessitates them within
these contexts, however, there are no focused studies that delve
into understanding why they self-track, what they track, and how
they use self-tracked data on a broader scale.
Within human-computer interaction, self-tracking is also com-
monly studied in the personal informatics (PI) field. The areas of
workplace [ 16,61] and productivity tracking [ 40,53] within PI
share some similarities with gig workers as they are concerned
with labor, but largely focus on the traditional workforce. Addi-
tionally, some HCI researchers have explored how to enhance gig
workers’ reflecting and acting on their own data [ 115,116], based
on the stage-based model of PI [ 58]. While PI has begun to be
studied within the context of gig work, researchers have yet to
comprehensively understand gig workers’ behavior and activity of
self-tracking.
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
Given these identified research gaps, we aimed to answer the
following research questions: 1) Why do gig workers self-track?
and 2) How do gig workers self-track? (i.e., what tools do they
use, what data do they collect, how do they use their data). To
answer these, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with
gig drivers (i.e., rideshare, delivery, courier) from a diverse set of
gig platforms who use a variety of self-tracking tools in their work
lives. Applying an inductive thematic analysis approach to our data,
it became apparent how gig workers use self-tracking to uphold
accountabilities they hold across three distinct identities: personal
accountabilities of the holistic self, fiscal and resource accountabili-
ties of the entrepreneurial self, and performance accountabilities
of the platformized self. Based on these findings, we discuss the
self-accountability gig workers demonstrate and how self-tracking
is a form of invisible labor. We further discuss self-tracking’s role
in mitigating information and power asymmetries in gig work and
provide design implications for multi-dimensional self-tracking.
With this study, we make several contributions to the field of HCI.
First, we provide empirical insights into how gig workers utilize self-
tracking to effectively manage their multi-dimensional accountabil-
ities. This sheds light on the intricacies of the gig economy, which
holds relevance for both academic inquiry and practical applications.
Second, our research enriches the ongoing discourse concerning the
prevalent information and power asymmetries within the gig econ-
omy. Third, we present design implications aimed at facilitating gig
workers’ intricate task of managing multi-dimensional accountabil-
ity through self-tracking. These contributions collectively enhance
our understanding of the gig economy’s digital landscape and its
implications for workers.
2 Related Work
The gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-
term, flexible jobs, often facilitated through digital platforms or apps.
In this model, individuals, referred to as gig workers, operate as
independent contractors with increased autonomy, taking on tasks
or projects on a temporary or part-time basis [ 67]. In a recent survey,
McKinsey found that 36% of employed U.S. respondents (around
58 million individuals) identify as independent workers, growing
from 27% in 2016 [ 26]. Examples of gig work include rideshare (e.g.,
Uber), food delivery (e.g., Doordash), courier (e.g., Roadie), freelance
work (e.g., Fiverr,), and crowdwork (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk).
Different services exhibit distinct characteristics, encompassing
variations in service models, customer interaction, location, and
complexity [27, 48, 109].
As independent contractors, gig workers shoulder a unique form
of accountability as they self-manage the intricacies of their roles,
marked by a notable degree of autonomy and responsibility as a
result of platformization and algorithmic management. They must
manage various aspects of their work lives from before, during,
and after working to maintain an advantage and stay profitable
on that platform [ 2,49]. Existing studies on self-management have
predominantly focused on business leaders [ 25,36], who, similar
to independent contractors, operate with a high degree of auton-
omy and are responsible for managing their work without immedi-
ate oversight. In these studies, the concept of self-management is
closely intertwined with self-accountability as it acts as an internalcontrol system in the absence of being answerable to another party
[25,36]. Self-management, as defined in studies with independent
contractors and business leaders, involves exerting heightened per-
sonal control over one’s career in the absence of direct supervision.
It includes a broad set of activities (i.e., defining working hours,
managing finances, and setting goals) that allow individuals to
enhance productivity, achieve objectives, and make work-related
progress. While self-management typically employs various tech-
niques to reach diverse goals, our focus centers on exploring how
gig workers self-track to manage their unique needs and situations.
Gig workers in the U.S. must track information about themselves
(e.g., income and mileage) for tax reporting purposes [ 45]. To mon-
itor these essential data points and other kinds of information, gig
workers have access to various tools including gig platforms, third-
party tools, and manual tracking methods. Gig platforms provide
in-app tracking features such as platform metrics (Table 1) or ac-
tivity information (Table 2). Platform metrics are measurements
used to assess performance, while activity information consists of
information that are not direct performance indicators. The tables
below present tracked metrics and information on various gig plat-
form driver apps, organized based on their functions. There are
also several third-party applications (e.g., Gridwise, Stride) that
cater to gig workers. These typically include mileage and expense
tracking for tax needs and can include features like smart tools to
maximize earnings or information on high-demand areas. Workers
can also manually track their activity using pen and paper, or digital
spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
Below, we examine existing literature on accountability and
self-tracking practices among gig workers. We first review account-
ability literature and connect this to existing discussions on gig
worker accountability. We then examine personal informatics liter-
ature and connect this to how self-tracking has been observed or
studied amongst gig workers.
2.1 Accountability and Gig Work
Accountability and responsibility are often conflated with one an-
other, but there lie subtle differences in how each is felt and assigned.
Responsibility implies self-control and obligation, while account-
ability involves being answerable to another party (i.e., a coworker,
supervisor, or customer) or to oneself [ 25,85]. Along with being
answerable is the expectation that an “evaluation may occur” and
that an “explanation [by the one held accountable] is required” [ 42].
While the two can be used interchangeably, responsibility is the
broader of the two as it encompasses a range of obligations, duties,
and tasks that may include an individual’s accountabilities. We
use accountability for this study as it is a more relational concept
that captures the intricacies of various relationships, expectations,
and influences that shape gig workers’ behavior and decisions. To
understand this subject, we review literature that has explored the
accountability of self-employed individuals, contractors, and gig
workers.
2.1.1 Self-Employed and Contractor Accountability. Studies on self-
employed individuals have specifically looked into their financial
accountabilities given the increased responsibilities and enhanced
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
complexities surrounding their self-employment [ 6,97]. Here, re-
searchers explore the increased accountabilities self-employed in-
dividuals have surrounding managing their finances and taxes as
they are accountable to systems in place – rather than individuals
– such as tax or child-care organizations [ 6]. For contractors in the
government [ 5,22] and military [ 41,70,76], researchers mainly
explore accountability in adverse incidents: who is and should be
legally held accountable, and whether that ownership makes sense
considering the contractor-employer relationship. There are simi-
lar discussions surrounding accountability in accidents involving
gig workers. There have been cases leading to injury or death
where gig platforms avoided accountability as they argue their po-
sition as a matching or networking service instead of a rideshare
or delivery company [ 19]. Drivers found themselves in a gray area
when accidents occurred while logged on and looking for another
gig, but not while fulfilling a delivery or ride service [ 87]. These
instances highlight gig workers’ independent contractor classifica-
tion, how platform companies distance themselves from the worker
to maintain this classification [ 93], and how these companies ex-
ploit employee classification systems to reap “rewards without risk
and responsibility” [113].
2.1.2 Gig Worker Accountability. Explorations into gig workers’ ac-
countabilities also consider how accountability is shifted between
the worker and platform due to workers’ classification as inde-
pendent contractors – particularly what the platform will take
accountability for and what they leave to the worker. Researchers
have observed how gig workers are accountable for maintainingseparate records of their activity that are also automatically and
algorithmically evaluated by the platform [ 75,99]. As a result, they
must manage their standing with “reputation auditing” where they
rectify platform records to more accurately reflect their experiences
[75]. Workers do this by maintaining records of their activity which
they use to support claims, thus redirecting the accountability they
previously held to the platform or customer [ 98,99]. These reports
signify the precarious relationship between contractor and em-
ployer as they serve as the focal point of accountability negotiation
between the two parties.
In summary, accountability researchers have primarily explored
how contractors and self-employed workers manage their unique
accountability dynamics with companies or not having anyone to
directly report to. While the subjects of these studies draw sim-
ilarities to gig workers, the elements of their employment still
differ, particularly when considering the ambiguous boundary they
walk between contractor and employee [ 93]. Studies exploring gig
worker accountability highlight how their classification as inde-
pendent contractors affects how accountability is managed and
delegated between themselves and the platforms they serve. While
these studies delve into the construction of accountability in these
relationships, they don’t explore how gig workers internally man-
age accountability. This study addresses this gap by reporting on
how gig workers self-track to oversee their accountabilities.

2.2 Personal Informatics and Gig Work
Personal informatics (PI) is “a school of thought which aims to use
technology for acquiring and collecting data on different aspects
of the daily lives of people” [ 92]. PI systems are those that “help
people collect personally relevant information for self-reflection
and gaining self-knowledge” [ 58]. Research in PI has explored self-
tracking across various populations such as Quantified Selfers [ 15]
and knowledge workers [ 53], as well as diverse domains like men-
struation [ 30], physical activity [ 107], and finance [ 52]. Notably, the
field has heavily focused on health and wellbeing, data collection
and reflection, and behavior change motivations [29].
2.2.1 Workplace and Productivity Tracking. While gig workers’
self-tracking activities have only sparsely been studied by re-
searchers, two more commonly explored areas of workplace and
productivity tracking draw some similarities to gig work. Work-
place and productivity tracking both explore how tracking can
be used to enhance activity, performance, and output, with work-
place tracking being broader as it also encompasses work-related
productivity tracking. Workplace tracking involves tracking to sup-
port, raise awareness of, or manage individuals in the workplace.
Research has highlighted its benefits in enhancing collaboration
among colleagues [ 61], improving workplace health and wellbeing
[16], and increasing productivity [ 53]. Closely related is produc-
tivity tracking which has been understood in both the workplace
context and on a more individual level. Researchers have explored
ways to improve [ 53] or quantify [ 54] productivity. Productivity
researchers have looked into how tracking productivity can en-
hance wellbeing as workers balance and reflect on productive time
alongside breaks [ 23,40], leading to increased awareness and per-
ception of their work [ 40,53]. However, while researchers have
highlighted the utility of both workplace and productivity tracking,
they also note negative side effects such as issues of surveillance
[3, 89], heightened stress [73], and pressure to track [44, 104].
Workplace and productivity tracking studies are somewhat re-
lated to gig workers as they center on labor, however, the two
primarily focus on traditional workplaces where employees an-
swer to a supervisor or work collaboratively with others. The study
subjects are often information and knowledge workers such as
software developers, designers, and researchers [ 28,53,60,71].
Tracking in these contexts differs from that of gig workers as they
lack direct supervisors, necessitating increased self-management
and accountability. Gig workers’ self-tracking use and experiences
remain understudied, but some HCI researchers have begun investi-
gating ways to enhance gig workers’ reflecting and acting on their
data. One study explored using social sensing (a collaborative ef-
fort with drivers’ partners to understand and make decisions based
on their data) to help drivers understand their health and achieve
work-life balance [ 115]. Another explored the challenges surround-
ing algorithmic management by focusing on how the design and
presentation of data influence the wellbeing and work experience of
gig workers [ 116]. The researchers found that their designs served
as boundary objects in AI, helping participants gain insights about
their work activity and experiences.
2.2.2 Gig Worker Self-Tracking. Some researchers have noted gig
workers’ self-tracking activity concerning their tax responsibilities[82,83] and self-protection [ 10,75,99]; however, there has not
been an in-depth empirical study of these tracking behaviors. Gig
workers’ self-employed status increases their tax responsibilities
compared to employees of a company, placing additional administra-
tive burdens on their shoulders [ 106]. These include self-reporting
income and maintaining thorough records for potential IRS au-
dits [ 83]. Failure to maintain records of their income, expenses,
or mileage may result in tax challenges [ 82,106]. Furthermore,
while some gig platforms track workers’ income and mileage, the
reported mileage is often an incomplete account of the worker’s
actual business mileage [ 82,83]. As a result of gig workers’ unique
tax circumstances, researchers in this field have identified the need
for gig workers to engage in self-tracking as they relate to their tax
requirements.
Self-tracking has also been observed as a response to the al-
gorithmic management and platform surveillance that gig work-
ers experience. Platform algorithms compare worker data against
company-specific metrics as indicators of performance [ 110,111],
leading to workers constantly monitoring their metrics to assess
their performance [ 10] and avoid consequences such as fewer job of-
fers or deactivation [ 55,66]. As such, this algorithmic management
is often referred to as a form of workplace surveillance as platforms
seek to control workers’ performance and behavior on the job
[74,80]. Workplace tracking researchers have similarly raised con-
cerns surrounding increased surveillance in the workplace, drawing
comparisons to Foucault’s panopticon [ 3,89]. Platform surveillance
prompts workers to engage in self-protective measures such as
tracking conversations with support to ensure issues are resolved
[10], record-keeping as a way to protect themselves in disputes
[99], and “reputation auditing” with their tracked data as a way of
resolving poor metrics [ 75]. This body of research has observed the
use of self-tracking and the motivation behind it as a form of self-
protection, however, it lacks an in-depth exploration of self-tracking
behavior.
In summary, despite research in workplace and productivity
tracking sharing some similarities with gig work as they all center
on labor, studies here predominantly focus on knowledge workers
in traditional settings. This differs significantly from non-traditional
work arrangements in the gig economy where workers lack direct
supervision and tracking is more closely tied to financial and legal
implications, such as their heightened tax accountabilities. Further-
more, while researchers have begun to recognize the self-tracking
needs of gig workers, there is a lack of grounding in empirical
research that focuses on why and how they self-track. Existing gig
worker studies show that self-tracking is used in various dimen-
sions of a worker’s activity, prompting an investigation into how
self-tracking among gig workers might result in unique practices
and experiences. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of
how gig workers use self-tracking to maintain accountability given
their categorization as self-employed, independently contracted
workers.
3 Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 gig drivers to
understand their use of self-tracking tools and how these tools
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
support their work, then used an inductive thematic analysis [ 7,18]
to analyze the data.
3.1 Participant Recruitment
We focused on recruiting gig drivers (i.e., rideshare, food delivery,
and courier drivers) due to their unique tracking behaviors where
they track not only time and finances but also mileage for tax
deductions [ 105]. This data dimension offers insights into their self-
tracking practices and data interpretation, distinct from other kinds
of gig work. Microtaskers (e.g., Task Rabbit, Handy) were excluded
as they are less common than rideshare and delivery roles available
across most U.S. cities. Additionally, rideshare and delivery drivers
do similar enough jobs that there are overlaps in those groups.
Recruitment was done both online and offline. For online re-
cruitment, we planned to post solely on gig work-related forums
(subreddits) on Reddit that allowed calls for research participants
but found that several subreddits prohibited posting about research
studies. Therefore, we expanded the search to include non-gig
work-targeted subreddits and were able to post (with permission)
on a total of eight subreddits (r/GigWork, r/amazonflexdrivers,
r/UberEATS, r/Grubhubdrivers, r/roadie, r/SampleSize, and a sub-
reddit for the authors’ university). Despite the limitation, we were
still able to recruit a diverse set of participants due to the phenom-
enon of “multi-apping”, where gig workers work with a variety of
platforms at a time instead of being constrained to just one [ 38].
For offline recruitment, we created and distributed flyers to various
local establishments (e.g., restaurants, cafes, community centers,
school buildings) to reach gig workers in our community.
All recruitment messages included information on the study goal,
expected interview length, compensation, inclusion criteria, and a
link to the screener survey. This survey collected preliminary data
to select a diverse group of participants based on demographics
(e.g., How old are you?, To which gender identity do you most
identify?), gig work specifics (e.g., What specific gig platform/s
do you currently work on?), and self-tracking tool use (e.g., What
apps or tools do you use for tracking related to your job?). Of the
380 individuals who completed the screener survey, 274 met the
inclusion criteria: being in the U.S., aged 18 or older, working as a
gig driver (e.g., rideshare, courier, delivery), and self-tracking for
gig work. We used purposeful sampling techniques [ 86] to select a
diverse sample in terms of their background (i.e., race, gender, age)
and their gig work activity (i.e., platforms they worked on, tracking
applications they used).
We interviewed 25 participants whose demographics and gig
work details can be found in Table 3. Ages ranged from 24 to 62
years (median = 30). Of the participants, 14 identified as male, 7 iden-
tified as female, 2 identified as non-binary, and 2 did not disclose.
For types of gig work, 17 participants did some sort of delivery
(i.e., food delivery or courier service), 6 did rideshare, and 2 did
both delivery and rideshare. The difference between rideshare and
delivery drivers can be explained by several participants stopping
rideshare and moving to delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
aligning with gig worker activity across the U.S. [ 96]. Participants
used various tracking methods including automatic tracking ap-
plications, pen and paper, spreadsheets, and gig platform-based
tracking features.3.2 Data Collection
Interview questions covered the information they paid attention to
and tracked (e.g., What information do you find useful to know to
perform your job activities?, What information about you do the gig
platforms track and present to you?), their choice of self-tracking
tools (e.g., What made you select your tracking app?, What are
your criteria for a tracking tool?), their use of self-tracking tools
and self-tracked data (e.g., Why do you track?, What do you learn
by looking at your data?), and their experiences with work-related
tracking (e.g., How do you feel about tracking your data for work?,
What challenges do you encounter while self-tracking for work?).
Probing questions were dynamically created when needed to gather
additional insights. After the initial ten interviews, the interview
protocol was refined. The changes involved adding common follow-
up questions (e.g., ‘How often do you look at this information?’
in regards to platform metrics), revising questions for clarity (e.g.,
‘How do you make sense of data from different tracking sources?’
turned to ‘How do you evaluate or integrate data you have from
different tracking apps?’), and eliminating questions with redun-
dant answers (e.g., ‘Do you need to distinguish between data from
different gig platforms?’ and ‘Do you have different tracking needs
based on the different platforms?’).
Interviews were conducted in English, video and audio recorded,
and transcribed verbatim, with recordings and transcriptions stored
in a password-protected database. Participants provided verbal
consent to being recorded, receiving detailed information on the
study, their rights as volunteers, and data usage. They were also
given the opportunity to ask questions about the study. Interviews
lasted approximately 30-90 minutes (median = 47 minutes, average
= 49.76 minutes). Upon completion, 24/25 participants received a $30
Amazon gift card as compensation and one was compensated $15
as they did not complete the interview. This participant was only
able to partially complete the interview due to Internet connection
issues, and we were unable to reschedule a follow-up interview.
Nonetheless, they provided valuable insights into questions related
to how they track, why they track, and how they use their tracked
data for work-related activities.
3.3 Data Analysis
We used reflexive thematic analysis to iteratively code data and
generate themes with a bottom-up approach. Following Braun &
Clarke’s six phases [ 7,18], the first two authors familiarized them-
selves with the data by reviewing recordings and fixing transcrip-
tions, then used Google Sheets to code by independently inspecting
quotes and creating detailed descriptions of participants’ activities
and experiences that were meaningful and relevant to the study.
After coding, the two authors met to discuss codes by highlighting
interesting points and reviewing similar or unclear codes. Following
these meetings, the two authors met with the rest of the research
team to discuss and refine codes as needed. The final set includes
557 unique codes such as “paying attention to platform metrics
to avoid consequences (i.e., deactivation) that may happen if you
reach a certain number,” “seeing self-tracking as something you
have to do as a business,” and “tracking to get a picture of where
they stand when calculating all income and expenses. ” The first two
authors then generated initial themes by grouping similar codes, an
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
iterative process where the authors refined themes for cohesiveness
and distinction. The full research team then reviewed candidate
themes to ensure they made sense and were a representative analy-
sis of the full dataset. Once the themes were set, the team proceeded
with defining and naming themes to specify and differentiate them.
Finally, the team began the writing process to weave together the
analysis with data extracts to create a coherent account of the data.
4 Findings
Participants’ self-tracking behaviors were closely linked to the ac-
countabilities they held. Three identities crystallized as a result of
observing and analyzing how participants navigated and expressed
themselves concerning their roles and obligations, shedding light on
why and how gig workers engage in self-tracking. First is the holis-
tic self where gig workers self-track to manage personal account-
abilities and empower themselves. Second is the entrepreneurial
self where gig workers consider fiscal and resource accountabilities
as self-employed, independently contracted workers. Finally, we
have the platformized self where workers manage performance
accountabilities as they navigate relationships with the platforms
and customers.4.1 Personal accountability to the holistic self
Gig workers maintain personal accountabilities to both themselves
and others. They are self-accountable for learning their capacity
for work, making decisions, achieving work/life balance, and recog-
nizing achievements. They are also accountable to their network,
particularly when their work directly impacts those relationships.
For instance, if a worker depends on their gig income to support
their family, they are accountable for generating sufficient income
for their family’s needs. These encapsulate the holistic selves that
gig workers self-track to gather knowledge on and act in the inter-
est of, enabling them to make informed decisions about when, how
much, and which jobs to take.
However, gig platforms do not provide adequate tools that can
help workers track for their holistic selves. For example, several
participants, aligning with existing studies, reported incomplete
mileage [ 82,83] or incorrect income [ 10] tracking by gig platforms.
Additionally, our participants reported that platform-tracked in-
formation often centers around metrics or factors pertinent to the
platform company (i.e., job-related metrics) which may not be rele-
vant for workers’ needs:

Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
“I would say [my tracking] has to do with personal
stuff, but theirs has to do with business. So, [their
tracking is] after probably their money, their sales,
their business. For my [tracking], I’m improving my-
self, [working] on myself, [staying] out to make my-
self better than [...] the last day.” (P11)
Thus, participants used third-party tracking tools in addition to
platform-provided information. With external tools, they can track
personally relevant information that may not be tracked by gig
platforms like time spent working, overall mileage, or personal expe-
riences while working. Additionally by calculating, analyzing, and
reviewing this data, they can learn what the job is like, determine if
their jobs are worth continuing, know how much they’re earning,
monitor productivity, and manage work/life balance. With this,
workers are empowered as they gain knowledge about themselves,
reflect on their activity, and make informed decisions. Self-tracking
allows them to cultivate their autonomy and flexibility as they can
use their collected information to act in their own self-interest.
4.1.1 Generating self-knowledge. Self-tracking grants gig workers
a quantified and monitored understanding of their activity, provid-
ing them with valuable insights into the details and dynamics of
their work lives which can be used to make professional and per-
sonal decisions. Previous studies found that since workers navigate
the gig landscape independently, they used online communities to
learn about the job [ 47,114]. Beyond this, we found that partici-
pants used self-tracking to understand gig work as it pertained to
their unique experiences, particularly due to the market-dependent
nature of gig work:
"A lot of gig work [...] is market dependent. Los Ange-
les is going to [be] a lot different [from] where I am in
Kentucky. So you can’t compare your city to Los An-
geles, they just have different food and demographics. "
(P6)
Each worker’s experience could significantly differ from another
due to differing local market conditions that impact job pricing and
availability [ 11,27]. As a result, there is limited information that
they can exchange to learn about the gig work experience, implying
that workers should explore more personalized methods to gain
insights into working within their specific market. For instance,
self-tracking mileage, working time, and income specifically helped
P25 understand gig work as it pertained to their unique experiences:
“In the beginning with Shipt, when I was tracking,
I also was just learning about gig work and how it
worked, and really tracking how much I was making
an hour, how much time I was working in coordina-
tion with how much I was making in a month. And
so, I guess just like learning the capacity of how much
I could make.” (P25)
Tracking also allowed them to learn more about the platforms
they serve: “The more data you have points to the [...] things you
can start tracking and seeing, and suddenly things come to light.”
(P14). P14 shared how they were able to understand assignment
algorithms by observing their tracked pay data where. From there,
they noticed they were not paid consistent rates by Amazon: “If I
never put together a spreadsheet for some of these base [pays] [...]I would have thought in my head it’s just coincidence that some
of these lower-paying shifts have been some of my worst shifts.”
(P14). Having their tracked data available to them allowed them to
see a pattern in what kinds of jobs were being sent their way.
Self-tracking their activity also gave workers an objective per-
spective of their activity to monitor their productivity, efficiency,
and finances as they relate to their needs and goals:
“[Tracking is] like a way of giving myself a reality
check because it means that at the end of the day, I
am accountable for what I’m doing. So at the end of
the day, I can always check to see what I’m doing
right or if I’m doing it wrong.” (P23)
Given how our participants demonstrated how they self-track
their business expenses, income, mileage, and the time they spend
working to learn more about themselves, we find that self-tracking
allows gig workers to gather relevant insights about their behavior,
activity, and experience. This includes learning what the job could
look like for them, what working for the platform is like, and how
they are performing in the job. Having this data increases their
self-awareness and autonomy as they can learn from and act on
their tracked data.
4.1.2 Evaluating data to inform work and life. With enhanced
awareness of their performance, gig workers can evaluate their
work in alignment with their personal, professional, and financial
goals:
“For me, [tracking is] good because it helps you to
know if what you’re doing is worth it or not, because
you don’t just work because you want to work. You’re
working because you want to make a living out of it.
[...] So you have to work and have a [record] of what
you’re doing. If it’s not good, if it’s not working very
well, you can decide to take up a different job.” (P2)
Using self-tracking tools allows them to dynamically review and
evaluate their data, informing the decisions and assessments they
make. Some participants engage in performance assessments by
reviewing the efficiency and the viability of their work using data
on their income, expenses, mileage, and time. With this data, they
can evaluate “if it is something [they] still need to continue, or if
[they are] actually gaining or earning from this kind of work. ” (P13).
Several participants shared an example highlighting a gig worker’s
decision-making process, which includes calculating income against
expenses like gas and time costs. This becomes crucial when dealing
with low-paying, far-distance jobs that may yield a low dollar-
per-mile or dollar-per-hour ratio, potentially leading to financial
losses due to higher operating costs. Others tracked and evaluated
income from various jobs, especially when working for multiple
gig platforms simultaneously (multi-apping): “I also compare with
some of my [other jobs] as well. [...] I’m getting $125 here a day and
I’m getting $110 here.” (P20). From there, participants shared how
they reconsidered their involvement with different gig applications:
“Freelance is where I’m spending most of my time
because after my analysis, I have found that it is more
profitable to me. [...] I’m getting more per hour com-
pared to the Uber jobs. [...] It gives me the rating on
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
my gigs and which gig is better than the other. Just
to make my decisions personally.” (P16)
With their tracked data, participants can also collaborate with
family members to determine if their work is worthwhile. In the
case of P10, they reviewed their data with their wife to evaluate
income earned, mileage, and time spent on gig work:
“Sometimes I’ll sit down with my wife [...]and take a
look at [my spreadsheet] and see. ‘Okay, you work
this amount of hours, you made this much. At the end
of the day is it worth it?’ [...] She’ll take a look at it
from a family perspective. ‘Okay, so you made this,
you worked this many hours, you traveled this far.
Okay, what did you miss? You know our son did this.
Our grandkids did this. We could have done this.’ So
she’ll kind of throw that in there. And that’s what I
use to evaluate, if that makes sense.” (P10)
In summary, self-tracking fosters a heightened sense of auton-
omy and control in gig workers’ personal and professional lives
as they can make data-driven decisions regarding their jobs using
insights from their collected data. This is particularly important as
gig work is inherently independent, with no coworkers or managers
who can observe their work. Self-tracking provides a sense of orga-
nization and control over their jobs, and helps workers maintain
accountability for the different responsibilities they may hold.
4.2 Fiscal and resource accountabilities to the
entrepreneurial self
Gig workers have to consider their obligations and accountabilities
as self-employed individuals to both themselves and the govern-
ment. These include tax preparation, financial management, time
management, and vehicle maintenance – all of which encapsulate
the fiscal and resource accountabilities of the entrepreneurial selves
that gig workers must manage.
To navigate the multiple accountabilities of self-employed con-
tractors, participants shared how they have to keep track of dif-
ferent aspects of their activity: “I have to be the one doing all the
aspects: both the finance, both the planning, both the schedule –
kind of everything.” (P19). This includes personally tracking data
such as income, expenses, time, and vehicle-related information.
While platforms have some data that may be helpful for workers
(see Table 2), oftentimes gig workers do not find this sufficient for
managing their business due to that information being incomplete
or being presented ineffectively as shared by our participants and
in prior studies [ 10,82,83]. The information they track is then used
to manage the accountabilities they hold as part of “running a good
business” (P9):
“You know, I’m a company. I don’t have an LLC or
anything like that, but I’m running a business, so to
speak. And part of [that] is keeping track of what’s
going on. So you know what’s going on, you’re not
guessing.” (P9)
By tracking different aspects of their daily routines and reviewing
summaries or analyses of them (i.e., total profit, dollars per hour),
gig workers maintain accountability for the various responsibilities
related to their status as self-employed contractors.4.2.1 Managing and evaluating finances. Gig work’s flexibility,
independence, and earning potential make it an appealing option
for individuals seeking some source of income [ 67]. Self-tracking
finances offers workers the ability to fully evaluate the viability of
gig work and understand their financial situation: “I just wanted to
know if financially I’m doing okay. If the job is paying. So that is
why I look at [my data] like, oh am I doing well? Is this business
okay?” (P20).
While PI researchers have explored financial tracking [ 52,57],
gig workers’ approach differs from occupations engaged in per-
sonal budgeting and financial tracking due to the precarious nature
of gig work [ 65] resulting in variable, inconsistent income [ 21].
Given this, gig workers must be diligent in documenting pay, man-
aging deductions, and setting aside money for taxes, as they lack
automatic paycheck deductions:
”It’s good to be able to calculate the actual amount
of money I earned and get out of the trap that these
apps put you in. [They] make you appear like you’re
earning more than you actually are. But having an
accurate representation, especially around taxes and
wear and tear on my car, tracking that has given me a
little bit more reassurance that I’m not just doing this
in desperation.” (P15)
While platforms collect and display income information, work-
ers transfer this data to external tracking applications to connect
it with their expenses. Doing so provides them with a comprehen-
sive perspective of their financial standing as they can calculate
profits, helping them manage their money effectively. Participants
shared how tracking enables them to review their business expenses
alongside their income to know whether the job is profitable:
“It helps me to know what I’m earning and what
I’m spending, my expenditure versus my revenue.
It makes me very prudent and very reliable with my
spending habits. [...] If I’m really getting a profit out of
what I’m doing after the whole tax deduction.” (P21)
To evaluate their profitability on a smaller scale, participants
calculated their net income per hour and net income per mile. This
helped them visualize their earnings in the face of pay inconsistency:
"Some days you only make X amount per hour, and the others you
make more. I try to look at it as you would a regular job where you
get a week’s pay." (P9). Several participants also emphasized the
importance of considering fluctuating gas prices, so they calculated
net income per mile as a way of managing that instability: "You
want to keep track of your profitability [with] dollars per mile. [...]
It’s only worth your while with gas being as much as it is." (P10).
Some participants also monitored both work and non-work ex-
penses to assess whether their lifestyles contributed to achieving
their profit goals: “If I feel I have overspent within the month [then]
I cut down the expenditure or increase my savings for the [next]
month.” (P1). Having this information available to them allows them
to proactively adjust their spending behavior and earning activities
according to their goals.
In summary, due to the flexibility and independence associated
with the gig economy, workers must diligently track their income
and expenses to evaluate the profitability and viability of working
in the gig economy.
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
4.2.2 Fulfilling tax obligations. As self-employed contractors, gig
workers are independently responsible for calculating, paying, and
providing accurate information for their taxes. Participants in this
study emphasized the importance of tracking to correctly file their
taxes and maximize their income from gig work: “I need to track
all of it, so I can do my taxes correctly and get my tax returns done
correctly.” (P5). Specifically, they shared how they meticulously
tracked gig work-related income, documented business expenses,
and recorded business mileage. These practices are crucial to en-
suring accurate tax filings and maximizing the potential for tax
returns.
Participants who had worked a W-2 job (a traditional employee
role) shared that the necessity of tracking for gig workers can feel
exploitative when they know that it isn’t done by everyone:
“It feels like a necessary evil. [...] It’s something that I
don’t have to do at my W-2 job. It’s something that
people at W-2 jobs don’t have to think about.” (P5)
In traditional employment roles, employers withhold taxes from
employees’ paychecks and remit this to the government as a way
of fulfilling employees’ income tax obligations [ 43]. Meanwhile,
independent contractors’ paychecks do not have any income tax
withheld, so they have increased responsibility to calculate and pay
their income and self-employment taxes [43].
Beyond tracking their activity, gig workers must also maintain
records of information they submit (i.e., income, business expenses,
mileage) in case they are audited by the IRS: “If something did hap-
pen where I had to give [the IRS] some documentation, I have this
[information] written down right here. ” (P9). Participants explained
that they are conscious of the potential implications of being au-
dited and, as a result, select a tracking tool that can help them if
the event were ever to arise:
“Shipt [the gig platform] wouldn’t track the mileage,
so that’s why I got Everlance [the tracking app]. [...]
With Uber Eats, [...] I’d have so many screenshots and
it wouldn’t be a perfect breakdown of every order ver-
sus Everlance [that] tracks my whole driving session
from start to finish. [...] So say, if I got audited and I
needed to prove that I drove X amount of miles that
I’m claiming on my taxes, if I didn’t have Everlance,
then I would probably have to go into Uber Eats and
go into every order detail and screenshot it.” (P25)
Here, P25 shared how they opted to use a third-party track-
ing tool since the platform they worked on, Shipt, did not track
mileage which they knew was needed for their taxes. On the other
hand, Uber Eats tracked one-way mileage per job, so it would be
extra work on their part to calculate total mileage come tax season.
Other participants shared similar sentiments as they used third-
party tracking tools to more accurately track mileage, resonating
with prior studies that noted how gig platforms only track mileage
when gig workers are actively on the job (i.e., making deliveries
or traveling with passengers) [ 82,83]. Given its importance for
taxes, participants emphasized the importance of accurately track-
ing mileage: "I will gladly pay money for a tool that guarantees that
at the end of the year, I can get that [mileage] deduction accurate."
(P7).Participants emphasized the pivotal role of tracking for tax pur-
poses in maximizing their profits from gig work, considering it the
most important aspect of their job: “If I didn’t [track mileage], I
would have not made money.” (P7). This is because their tax de-
ductible can “add up” (P5) due to how much mileage they put on
for gig work. This emphasis on mileage tracking stems from the
significant tax deductions they can claim when reporting mileage
and business expenses "otherwise there’s a big chunk of money you
just give away every year” (P10). The “standard mileage rate” is
used to determine deductible costs related to operating a personal
vehicle for business purposes [101]. Independent contractors who
use their personal vehicles for gig work can reduce the taxes they
pay with this deductible based on this rate and their total business
mileage from the previous year [82].
Having their tax-relevant information readily accessible and
organized on a tracking app is also crucial for workers when it
comes to filing their taxes. It not only speeds up the tax process
but also enhances the accuracy of the information they enter on
their tax forms:
“[Excel] gives me a huge spreadsheet of every drive
I made the entire year. [...] I can easily sum up how
many miles [I drove] for business versus personal.
[...] You get a number and you punch it into your tax
software and it spits out a deduction.” (P7)
In summary, due to their legal and financial tax obligations, gig
workers place high importance on being able to accurately file taxes,
maximize tax deductions, and maintain records of their data. To do
this, they self-track gig work-related income, business expenses,
and business mileage with carefully selected tools.
4.2.3 Maintaining vehicles. As independent contractors, gig work-
ers supply their own vehicles for the job [ 43], something especially
necessary for rideshare and delivery work. Participants noted the
accelerated wear and tear on their vehicles due to the nature of
their jobs: “I bought the car in the beginning of August, started
ridesharing not long after that. And I’ve already put on 35,000 miles.
Something that people will [do] in a year, I [do] it in just a few
months.” (P10). Due to this increased vehicle usage, gig workers also
track mileage to guide vehicle maintenance schedules. With this,
they prioritize vehicle upkeep and timely maintenance to manage
the higher mileage accumulated during gig work:
“You want to keep track of how your car is, how it’s
doing. [...] So, you’re gonna be going through the reg-
ular wear and tear of the car pretty often. Oil changes,
where most people would do it [...] maybe every two
to three months or so. On average [for me], every
three weeks, more or less.” (P10)
The increased usage and maintenance costs create a domino
effect, leading participants to monitor their car data (e.g., fuel ef-
ficiency, mileage, and oil levels) for more efficient vehicle use. P8
describes tracking and monitoring such data to reduce service cen-
ter visits and save on maintenance expenses:
“Say on May 1st, [...] so first of the month, I have that
much oil life left based on the onboard car computer. It
tells me I have 50%. And then I monitor this situation
and check it a month later. So, June 1st, and I saw [it
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
is] 40%. [...] So, 10% decrease in a month. So, what did
I do? Did I drive harshly or not? I can backtrack and
see how I can reduce that number.” (P8)
In summary, gig workers heavily rely on their vehicles for their
duties, necessitating self-tracking vehicle-related information for
efficient car maintenance scheduling and vehicle utilization. This
tracking allows them to maintain accountability and take necessary
actions for the upkeep of their vehicles, enhancing their autonomy
as contractors.
4.2.4 Managing time. Gig workers, as independent contractors,
must prioritize time management as they are compensated per
job, receiving income only upon job completion, unlike traditional
employees who receive hourly or annual salaries [ 43]. This under-
scores the importance of time for gig workers since their earnings
depend on the number of completed jobs; efficiency in completing
one job enables them to take on the next more quickly:
“Time yourself. Make sure you don’t spend unneces-
sary time on specific things. Because of the next client
that you [have, you] don’t know how many minutes
you go pick the person up. [...] Time is money.” (P11)
Gig workers can track and monitor time through external tools
or on the gig platform. However, some gig platforms either do not
display working time (Table 2) or only track working time. The
latter is an issue when workers want to see their total working time:
"DoorDash tracks whenever I’m logged on, but TripLog [tracks]
from the first thing in the morning to the last thing [in my day]."
(P1). Tracking total time spent working allows workers to evaluate
this against their income from a period to understand whether they
are spending their time effectively and efficiently as this directly
correlates to their income:
“Mostly what I do track is time and [income] so that I
know at least during this time to this time I worked
on a certain gig and it paid [a] certain amount so that
I can get my weekly and monthly accommodations.”
(P16)
Given the flexibility of gig work, there is also the possibility of
being constantly on-call or working irregular hours, but this isn’t
always the most strategic approach. While gig work offers flexible
scheduling, working with a strategy is ideal to prevent aimless work.
Participants shared how they manage their time when engaging
with these platforms by setting hourly income goals and identifying
the most profitable times to work:
“The hours spent is more important to me. I really
want to maximize the amount of money I make per
hour, so I usually work peak[s] – weekends and dinner
rushes. [...] I tend to stop working instead of stretching
out the time because I find that working more hours
isn’t necessarily gonna earn me the rate that I want,
it’s picking the right times to do it, that’s generally
around the dinner rushes.” (P15)
Tracking and monitoring how long it takes them to complete
a job also helps maintain flexibility in choosing when and how
long to work. This is particularly beneficial for workers who juggle
multiple jobs, responsibilities, and commitments. In the case ofP19, effective handling of diverse responsibilities is evident through
tracking the time they spend on jobs:
“[I track time] when I have other gig work to do and
I have a deadline to accomplish it, [but] I still want
to do rideshare. So, I dedicate five hours to do the
particular work [...] sometimes we get lost in time
and we get lost in [...] discussions with clients and
stuff like that.” (P19)
Participants who worked with Amazon Flex also shared how
they monitor their time with the platform to optimize earnings: ”I
calculate what my running weekly hours worked are because [...]
you can’t exceed 40 [hours in seven days] otherwise you won’t
get any more shifts.” (P14). Participants would track their time to
make informed choices on which blocks (similar to “shifts” and
differ based on pay, length, and number of deliveries) they take:
“You want to make sure that you’re not taking a low-paying block
for three hours. If that puts you at cap, then the next day you can’t
work a higher-paying three-hour [block].” (P7).
In summary, the payment structure and flexible work arrange-
ments of gig work commodifies workers’ time. As a result, par-
ticipants shared how they tracked time to evaluate productivity,
maximize dollars per hour, manage multiple jobs, and manage plat-
form limitations.
4.3 Performance accountability to the
platformized self
The platformized self refers to the worker’s identity that is influ-
enced by the activity and relationships (i.e., platform, customer)
they establish within the gig platform. Workers are lightly man-
aged by the platform through metrics and ratings (Table 1), which
can be either system-generated or customer-sourced [ 13]. Along
with metrics, workers may also see the definitions of these metrics
(i.e., what they calculate and look at) and infractions they com-
mit; however, it is not always clear when something will count
against them and how severely it may affect their metrics. As algo-
rithmic substitutes for management and performance evaluations,
gig workers are held accountable for the contents of their records
[75], necessitating them to actively understand their metrics, moni-
tor their performance, and maintain a favorable position to avoid
consequences or retain benefits. Given this, our participants demon-
strated how they self-tracked to understand how platform metrics
operate and manage their ratings to avoid consequences.
4.3.1 Understanding platform metrics and algorithms. Metrics play
a pivotal role in how gig platforms oversee workers, serving as
the primary means of evaluation, with P18 likening these to “an
evaluation from your employer. ” Poor metrics can be interpreted as
“[showing] you might be troublesome, not really dependent, not
somebody to trust” (P8). Because of the significant ramifications
tied to low metrics [ 55,66], participants possessed a clear under-
standing of their significance and the potential consequences of
failing to meet them. Alternatively, having good metrics can show
that they are “on a good path” (P19), as workers can be rewarded
with advantageous benefits such as better jobs and, therefore, better
pay [ 13]. Nevertheless, participants were attentive to their metrics
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
as they signaled to the platform and customers how they were
performing.
Despite the relevance of platform metrics, information asym-
metries exist (i.e., algorithmic opacity and lack of earning/pricing
transparency), hindering workers from fully understanding how
these metrics and algorithms function [ 27,50,98]. Consequently,
workers expressed curiosity regarding the tracking and calcula-
tion of their information prompting them to track and calculate
whatever information they could (e.g., mileage and income) to
gain insights into platform operations. For instance, resonating
with prior work on workers’ mistrust of platform-tracked income
[10], P5 shared how they checked whether platforms accurately
summed up income data: "I’ll get a calculator and just make sure
that they are adding up my income correctly." Despite this, par-
ticipants shared how they still faced uncertainty as meanings and
algorithms were not always straightforward. While doing simpler
calculations allowed them some insight into how platforms calcu-
lated straightforward data, other metrics with elements determined
by the platform could only be understood through monitoring these
metrics’ movements on platforms according to workers’ activities.
For instance, Amazon Flex employs a vague sliding scale system
to assess worker performance but is not transparent about what
moves the scale up or down:
“Those [platform metrics] I mentioned, somehow
Amazon lunges it together into a sliding scale of ‘Fan-
tastic’, ‘Great’, ‘Fair’, ‘At Risk. ’ [...] I have one delivered
and received issue and one on-time delivery issue, and
my bar is almost entirely ‘Fantastic’, like I’m just a
smidge off the top. But other people will get one de-
livered and received thing and it will knock them all
the way down to ‘Great’. No idea why, no idea how it
works. They won’t tell us, they never will.” (P7)
As workers were unsure how they were rated on this scale, they
also faced uncertainty surrounding which behaviors would drop
their ratings and potentially strip them of benefits or leave them
vulnerable to deactivation: “If it falls down to ‘At Risk’, then the fear
is that Amazon will kick you off the platform. Lower than ‘Fantastic’
matters a little bit because Amazon has a rewards program.” (P7).
Similarly, P10 shared an instance where they noticed their metrics
remained unchanged despite accepting more orders, leading to
questions about the evaluation process given its implications for
their work:
“You go in and you’ll do everything you can to get
your acceptance rate up, [but] we don’t see it going
up. I’ll go in, and I’ll take every single order. Eleven
orders and my Acceptance Rate will stay the same.
[...] I just question how does [the algorithm] work? I
don’t understand [it] sometimes.” (P10)
Acceptance rate is the percentage of received orders that dri-
vers accept [ 56]. However, as P10 did not see this metric chang-
ing despite accepting more orders, they began to question how
it was really evaluated by platforms. Relatedly, while reviewing
their platform-tracked data, P3 noticed declining metrics despite
not actively working so took a month off to monitor this. In that
period, their metrics continued to drop, causing feelings of distrust:
"I believe they manipulated their stats [...] I take that as an extralayer of nonsense that is completely unprofessional." (P3). As dis-
played by our participants, the lack of algorithmic transparency
impacts the worker-platform relationship by fostering distrust, cre-
ating uncertainty, and instilling fear as workers believe companies
withhold information without apparent reason. This aligns with
prior studies highlighting gig workers’ frustration with opaque
algorithms [50, 98].
In summary, given the potential consequences of poor metrics,
workers displayed heightened attention to them. By self-tracking
the same data points as platforms and monitoring their metrics,
workers made efforts to understand how algorithms operated and,
based on their understanding, adjusted their behavior to maintain
or improve them.
4.3.2 Acting according to metrics. Participants actively monitored
metrics to safeguard their reputation, adjusting their behavior to
maintain good standing and mitigate potential repercussions. Relat-
edly, Mosseri [ 75] discusses “reputation auditing” where gig work-
ers identify and address inaccuracies on gig platforms’ records.
Sannon et al. [ 99] also discuss reactive uses of self-tracked data
for self-protection, i.e., to contest pay discrepancies, use in pay
disputes, and protect against false claims. In addition to this, we
found participants proactively monitor their metrics to maintain
good standing, even before identifying inaccuracies, and remain
vigilant to potential consequences or poor ratings:
“If my rating goes lower, I definitely wanna be careful
and try not to do something that I did last time. Just to
be sure that it stays there. Same with the acceptance
rate because if you decline too many orders, if your
acceptance rate goes below 50%, then you’re not pri-
oritized for high-paying orders. So, it definitely keeps
you in check. At least for me personally, I look at it
all the time.” (P4)
To proactively monitor metrics, another participant described
taking notes of their deliveries to remember instances that might
negatively impact their metrics. These notes specified incidents
that prevented the worker from completing a delivery and what
consequence they anticipated, for example:
“I had one [delivery] where a business was closed [...]
because the entire office got COVID. So I made a note
just so I can remember to check my standings in a
few days to see if it counted against me.” (P7)
These served as bookmarks for potential issues such as not re-
ceiving payment or getting deliveries marked late or missing. As
P7 put it: “things that are abnormal that Amazon might come and
yell at me about.” In these instances, the participant was aware of
actions that may result in infractions in the eyes of the platform,
potentially impacting their metrics. By being proactive about pre-
venting poor metrics, participants demonstrated how they avoid
falling into a bad position which is crucial as this has implications
on their income and experience with gig work.
Participants also shared how they use tracked data (e.g., time
they completed a job) and photos of successfully delivered packages
during disputes, similar to prior work on reputation auditing [ 75].
In addition, we found that if workers can’t successfully dispute a
mark against them, they may opt to wait for its removal from their
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
record. Certain platforms like Amazon Flex automatically remove
marks after a certain number of deliveries, prompting workers to
track and monitor their deliveries to “gauge of how long it’s going
to take to work those issues off [their] standings” (P7).
In summary, participants displayed a heightened awareness of
their metrics and the associated consequences. As those being eval-
uated, they are then accountable for maintaining favorable metrics,
whether through continuous monitoring for maintenance or disput-
ing with self-tracked data. This behavior stems from concerns about
income loss from platform-sanctioned penalties (e.g., receiving un-
favorable orders) or job insecurity (e.g., deactivation). Leveraging
self-tracking enabled them to proactively manage metrics by in-
creasing awareness and holding themselves accountable for their
performance, customer satisfaction, and platform compliance.
5 Discussion
In our findings, we illustrated how gig workers self-track to main-
tain accountability across three distinct identities. First is the holis-
tic self, where they maintain personal accountabilities of learning
their capabilities in gig work, managing their work/life balance, and
acting in their self-interest. Second is the entrepreneurial self, char-
acterized by their being self-employed individuals managing fiscal
and resource accountabilities. Last is the platformized self, as they
navigate and negotiate performance-related accountabilities with
the platform and customers. Participants shared how due to insuffi-
cient platform tracking (summarized in Table 4) they self-tracked
various types of data (summarized in Table 5) to manage these
different accountabilities. Below, we reflect on the accountable self
that gig workers embody and the implications of our findings as
they relate to the invisible labor of self-tracking and asymmetries
present in gig work. We then offer design implications to support
self-tracking for gig workers’ multi-dimensional accountability.
5.1 The accountable self in gig work
Our findings describe how gig workers embody an ‘accountable
self’ as they have “the capacity and willingness [...] to give ex-
planations for [their] conduct” [ 68]. Their faceted identities are
organized considering gig workers’ simultaneous involvement in
multiple roles with distinct responsibilities [ 12]. Faceted identities
are influenced by social context as individuals play diverse roles,
navigate various relationships, and manage distinct expectations in
different social settings [ 24,32]. In the context of gig workers’ holis-
tic and entrepreneurial selves, these identities emerged due to the
unique responsibilities they bear toward themselves and external
stakeholders (e.g., family, government). Furthermore, participants
in our study referred to the gig work they do as a business, seeing
it as both an activity and a distinct business entity, aligning with
neoliberalism, a socio-economic ideology that views the self as an
enterprise that is “both a member of the firm and as itself a firm”
[8]. Within this framework, individuals work within organizations
and operate as independent enterprises, actively managing various
business-related accountabilities [ 69], i.e., fiscal and resource ac-
countabilities of the entrepreneurial self. Meanwhile, gig workers’
platformized selves can be seen as a form of performance of self-
presentation [ 37], as they must navigate outward-facing metrics
visible to algorithms and customers [77].Understanding how gig workers navigate their accountabilities
within a network of stakeholders (Figure 1) highlights the dynamics
within the gig economy. This knowledge is relevant for academic
exploration and has practical implications for policymakers, busi-
nesses, and labor advocates seeking to address the challenges and
opportunities presented by this landscape.
Within the accountable self, gig workers display accountability to
both external entities and themselves. In being self-accountable, in-
dividuals assume responsibility for their actions and decisions with-
out external observation or enforcement [ 35]. The independence
and atomization of gig work [ 114] led to primarily self-driven and
self-managed accountabilities across their various identities. While
prior literature has focused more generally on self-management,
i.e., studying how self-management is applied across various activ-
ities and goals [ 1,2,25,36,49], we focused on a specific form of
self-management where gig workers use self-tracking to maintain
accountability.
In the holistic self, gig workers demonstrate self-accountability
as their rational selves are accountable for maintaining their emo-
tional selves by maintaining an awareness of their activity, eval-
uating and reflecting on their performance, acknowledging their
achievements, and considering various perspectives on their work.
In the entrepreneurial self, gig workers, as self-employed individu-
als, are self-accountable to their businesses as a separate entity from
themselves. However, even when gig workers are accountable to
external parties, explanations or evaluations of one’s work are not
imminent, underscoring the role of self-accountability in managing
gig workers’ obligations. For example, regarding tax responsibili-
ties, repercussions typically surface in the event of an audit. This
necessitates gig workers’ self-accountability in proper and timely
tax filing. Similarly for the platformized self, disputing poor metrics
for performance accountability relies on workers initiating the dis-
pute process. Resonating with Ghanem & Castelli’s [ 36] findings on
the connection between identity and self-accountability in business
leaders, we find that gig workers’ external accountabilities (i.e.,
to the government, platforms, and customers) increase their felt
self-accountability as they recognize the importance of meeting
these external obligations to maintain their income and job.
Our findings underscore the multi-dimensional nature of gig
workers’ tracking-mediated accountabilities. Participants used self-
tracking to manage the multi-dimensional accountabilities they
bear. This differs from the focus of existing PI research which has
focused on tracking or affecting a singular aspect of the self, i.e.,
health [ 33], fitness [ 107], or productivity [ 53]. While researchers
have also explored integrating multiple sources of data, these sim-
ilarly focus on deriving insights that are relevant to a singular
dimension, i.e., health [ 59] or wellbeing [ 4]. PI researchers have
also considered how self-tracking systems can hold individuals
accountable for their behavior change goals [ 31] through the social
accountability that manifests through publicly posting one’s own
tracked data [ 78,81,112], the support they receive from posting
[20,28,78], and in-app rankings [ 39]. In contrast, our findings il-
lustrate that gig workers employ self-tracking to simultaneously
manage a broad spectrum of accountabilities that extend beyond
holding oneself responsible for behavioral change goals. Our par-
ticipants felt accountable for a varied group of people including
themselves, their families, and other entities. Our findings also

Figure 1: The Accountable Self of Gig Workers. Continuous lines represent gig workers’ accountability to various parties, while broken lines
depict potential accountability among these parties. Within the holistic self, the rational self is accountable for the emotional self, as discussed
in 5.1. Platforms are accountable to the government for legal and regulatory compliance. Platforms and customers hold mutual accountability,
primarily focused on trust and reliability.
expand on accountability research that largely emphasizes individ-
uals’ obligations to external parties, which is the more traditional
view of accountability [ 36]. For gig workers, self-tracking activi-
ties are not solely about external obligations; they also underscore
accountability to oneself.
Although gig workers must manage a wide spectrum of ac-
countabilities, our findings indicate that gig platform designs inade-
quately support gig workers’ accountability identities. Participants
consistently highlighted instances where gig platform tracking falls
short in capturing information crucial for maintaining account-
ability across various facets of their work (Table 4). As a result,
participants sought external tracking tools to fill these gaps. With
these tools, participants could track and sum up data from theentire period they work and test how apps track or even manu-
ally input data to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of
tracked data. Having to self-track thus places a burden on workers
to invest time in selecting and customizing tools to meet their ac-
countability management needs, such as in the case of P25. This
can be seen as a transfer of accountabilities primarily driven by the
absence of adequate design support for the multi-dimensional track-
ing needs of gig workers. Considering gig workers must navigate
multiple dimensions of accountability, external tools become neces-
sary to address this complex accountability landscape. We expand
on designing for multi-dimensional accountability management on
self-tracking tools in 5.4.
Table 4: Summary of insufficient data tracking or presentation by gig working platforms.
Expenses Income Mileage
Personal and business expenses are not tracked by
the gig platform.– Income is often separated by day or task, requiring
extra effort on the worker’s side to transfer this
information and calculate or view it in different
periods (i.e., weekly, monthly, per hour).
– Income may be miscalculated by the platforms.– If tracked by the platform (Table 2), mileage is
often separated by day or job, requiring extra effort
on the worker’s side to transfer this information to
be able to calculate or view it in different periods (i.e.,
weekly, monthly, per hour).
– Only calculated when the driver is actively working
on an assignment; not calculated by the platform
when drivers are driving and waiting to get a new
assignment.
Working Time Qualitative Experiences Platform Metrics
If tracked by the platform (Table 2), time spent
working is often separated by day or job, requiring
extra effort on the worker’s side to transfer this
information to be able to evaluate it alongside other
factors (i.e., mileage, income).Qualitative experiences of the worker (e.g., personal
accounts and notes on deliveries or clients) are not
collected by the gig platform.There is a lack of transparency in how metrics are
tracked, calculated, and used by the platform.

5.2 Self-tracking as invisible labor
Our research highlights gig workers’ self-tracking practices as a
form of invisible labor, emphasizing the significant effort and in-
vestment inherent in this activity. As our findings indicate, gig
workers have to expend considerable effort in tracking due to their
multi-dimensional accountabilities and the insufficiency of gig plat-
forms in supporting these needs with adequate data, as summa-
rized in Table 4. To manage their accountabilities, gig workers must
carefully select tools that fit their specific needs. They are also re-
sponsible for identifying the specific data to track and conducting
meticulous analyses, both of which are summarized in Table 5. Ad-
ditionally, they manage other tracking-related responsibilities such
as retaining records and reviewing past performance. Despite theconsiderable effort invested in self-tracking practices, gig workers
remain uncompensated for the additional workload they entail.
Gig workers are primarily paid on a per-task basis, which means
they are not compensated for managing activities beyond the gig
task. This payment structure perpetuates issues of unpaid, invisible
labor necessary to participate in the gig economy, e.g., emotional
and temporal labor [ 94], self-protective strategies [ 99], and work
engagements [ 108]. As independent contractors, gig workers see
accountabilities that are usually handled by one’s place of employ-
ment transferred to the individual. These include ensuring tax com-
pliance, covering business expenses, maintaining personal vehicles
for work, and managing work schedules, all of which can be self-
managed with self-tracking. While previous studies on independent
contractor self-management have largely focused on strategizing
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
[1,2,49], we also found gig drivers self-manage by tracking to fulfill
entrepreneurial self and platformized self accountabilities. Here,
the concept of self-tracking shifts from a managerial standpoint to
viewing the worker at the intersection of labor, datafication, and
self-actualization.
As gig workers self-track to manage shifted accountabilities,
we observed how self-tracking is done to navigate the unclear
boundary between contractors and employees as platforms do not
provide sufficient tracking features to support the management of
multi-dimensional accountabilities. In the U.S., the murky bound-
ary between employee and contractor that gig workers navigate
is rooted in the more commonly used binary methods of classify-
ing workers as either independent contractors or employees [ 93].
This poses a problem as gig workers share similarities with both
employees and independent contractors [ 43]. Gig platforms benefit
from classifying gig workers as contractors as they don’t have to
provide mandated benefits and protections such as health insur-
ance, minimum wage, and unemployment benefits [ 14,93]. One of
the key factors in the most commonly used worker classification
tests in the U.S. (Common Law Test, ABC test, Economic Real-
ities test) for determining worker classification is the degree of
control and independence a worker has [ 84,90,93]. Some argue
that platform metrics essentially control workers similar to tradi-
tional employees, evident in pervasive algorithmic management
and the fostered economic dependency on gig work [ 17]. Partici-
pants in our study demonstrated how they manage these forms of
control by understanding and managing their performance metrics
(platformized self) and tracking finances to maximize their income
(entrepreneurial self). While outdated, binary methods of classi-
fying workers that don’t effectively align with the gig economy
structure [ 43,64,90,113] persist, it’s likely that we will see minimal
changes in how gig workers are compensated. However, a trans-
formation in these systems is unfolding as several cases have been
raised surrounding the classification of gig workers with some suc-
cessfully reclassifying workers as employees and others granting
them employee-like benefits [14, 43, 113].
Reclassifying workers to receive benefits similar to employees
could transform how they self-track. If gig workers were to oper-
ate more like employees rather than business owners, tracking for
their entrepreneurial selves could change as they receive a more
stable income, more consistent hours, and would potentially use
company-owned resources for work. Harris & Krueger [ 43] pro-
pose an independent worker classification as a "middle ground
between traditional employment and independent contractors,"
offering increased protections and benefits comparable to those en-
joyed by employees, which could have implications on gig workers’
self-tracking. First, platform companies withholding taxes could
distribute tax accountability, reducing the administrative burden of
tax filing. This could bring changes to the timing of tax payments,
modifications to income calculation, and a less stressful tax manage-
ment process that currently relies on workers’ self-tracking. Second,
the implementation of wage and hour protections could potentially
reshape how gig workers track and manage their income and time,
introducing more structure and predictability. In summary, reclas-
sifying gig workers could reduce their accountabilities, lessening
the necessity for extensive tracking.Our findings also depict self-tracking as a burdensome neces-
sity for individuals to protect and preserve their jobs, underscored
by the legal and financial implications of not tracking. We found
that gig workers track their income and mileage to stay account-
able for their financial and tax-related obligations. P5 highlighted
the burden of tracking, a task absent in traditional workplace em-
ployment but necessary in gig work. Failure to track jeopardizes
tax filing accuracy and income optimization, resulting in financial
losses and the risk of IRS audits and fines. By putting individuals in
charge of their businesses, the gig economy seems to encapsulate
the ideal of neoliberalism, which centers on government deregula-
tion and emphasizes personal responsibility [ 34]. However, it fails
to acknowledge the power imbalances inherent in the gig economy
notably skewed in favor of the platform. Workers thus face disad-
vantages as they are not fairly compensated for essential work that
sustains their personal business and the platform ecosystem. The
gig economy, thus, challenges the sustainability of neoliberalism
as workers see increased accountabilities which they are not fairly
compensated for.
Given the issue of unnoticed and uncompensated self-tracking
labor, we would like to highlight worker advocacy groups like
the National Domestic Workers Alliance Gig Worker Advocates1
which prioritize fair compensation for gig workers. Advocacy in the
gig economy can unveil the invisibility of these practices, pushing
for recognition and compensation of essential tasks beyond gigs to
sustain their jobs and adhere to their legal duties.
5.3 Self-tracking to mitigate information and
power asymmetries
Self-tracking holds a nuanced role for gig workers. While high-
lighting the issue of uncompensated labor and the broader struc-
tural issues within gig work platforms is crucial, it’s worth noting
that tracking can be a means of empowerment and negotiation for
workers as they mitigate the information and power asymmetries
prevalent in the gig economy. Platforms notably withhold useful
information (i.e., algorithmic payment determinations, job assign-
ments, performance evaluations) to maintain control over workers
[27,50,63,79,98]. We found that as gig workers track their per-
formance and activity, they generate knowledge about themselves
and the platforms they work for, helping them mitigate pervasive
information and power asymmetries.
Tracking offers workers an objective overview of their perfor-
mance and activity, enabling self-assessment. This is beneficial as
platforms have deemphasized the true costs of platform work and
emphasized gross earnings without considering gas, maintenance,
and depreciation [ 63]. An accurate and historical view of their per-
formance (i.e., reviewing income in relation to time spent, miles
driven, or jobs done) lets workers know what they are capable of
doing and earning with gig work. With access to historical earnings
data, they can gain insights into a platform’s profitability, equipping
them to decide whether to work more or less with that platform. For
instance, P14’s consistent income tracking revealed pay rate fluctu-
ations and empowered them to make an informed decision about
their engagement with that platform. The knowledge workers gain
can mitigate information asymmetries related to pay and earning
1https://www.gigworkeradvocates.org/
CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Hernandez et al.
transparency as it provides insights into performance trends, allow-
ing them to plan their work hours and make job choices based on
past performance data. This grants them both an objective perfor-
mance perspective and insights into the gig platforms, empowering
them to make informed decisions about their work lives.
As workers gain knowledge of themselves and their jobs through
self-tracking (Table 5), they gain autonomy and control over their
professional lives. While platform metrics control and hold workers
accountable, external self-tracking allows workers to subvert this
control to some extent, e.g., disputing customer and platform issues
for self-protection [ 75,99] or collectively demystifying blackbox
algorithms [ 9,103]. Thus, self-tracking is useful but necessary as
a form of self-preservation and self-protection. This is despite the
observed autonomy paradox in gig work that contrasts the expec-
tations of autonomous and flexible work arrangements against the
reality of workers experiencing surveillance, control, and a lack of
access to information [ 51,63,79]. The enhanced autonomy they
experience draws similarities to PI studies where individuals are
empowered to manage their health using self-tracking [33, 88].
However, it’s crucial to note that workers cannot completely
eliminate information and power asymmetries through self-
tracking; rather, tracking empowers them to address and allevi-
ate challenges only to some extent. Power imbalances persist not
only within gig work structures but also extend into the design of
platform metrics, stemming from broader contexts such as legal
and economic frameworks. Our findings highlight the insufficient
support provided by platforms (Table 4), underscoring existing
power imbalances stemming from the lack of worker-centered de-
sign on gig platforms’ metrics and tracked data. Platform metrics
replace human supervisors as performance evaluators and, thus,
primarily exist to surveil workers rather than enable them to make
informed decisions, underscoring the autonomy paradox in gig
work. Gig platforms prioritize control and compliance – show-
casing surveillance-centered design – over supporting workers’
autonomy and wellbeing, i.e., constant monitoring [ 2], punitive
practices [13], and a lack of transparency [50].
This underscores the significance of worker rights advocacies
like Gig Workers Rising2which strive to establish enhanced legal
and economic structures including protections and benefits like
health insurance, job security, wage protection, and fair and trans-
parent labor practices and policies. These causes relate to projects
like Shipt Calculator [ 9] that seek to empower gig workers through
collective data tracking and sharing to increase wage transparency.
The tool employs collective self-tracking to audit and deconstruct
the algorithmic blackbox, which could shed light on additional
ways workers can empower themselves and mitigate existing asym-
metries through tracking. Current individualized self-tracking tools
also complement efforts for data collectives as a way to address
asymmetries in the gig economy [ 46,72,103,117]. While individual
self-tracking empowers workers to manage their affairs and gain
personal insights, data collectives offer the opportunity to view a
broader perspective. This can reveal industry-wide trends, highlight
common challenges faced by gig workers, and serve as a powerful
tool for advocacy and collective bargaining. By considering how
self-tracking can support advocacy work or data collective efforts,
2https://gigworkersrising.org/there is potential to utilize existing activities to not only improve
the conditions of individual gig workers but also contribute to sys-
temic changes within the gig economy, fostering a more equitable
and transparent future.
5.4 Design implications for supporting gig
workers’ multi-dimensional tracking
Our findings detail how it can be burdensome for gig workers to self-
track to independently manage multi-dimensional accountabilities.
This is exemplified by the necessity of tracking to meet tax and
financial obligations, and the task of selecting and customizing
a variety of tools and data for tracking and analysis. However,
existing PI literature predominantly focuses on tracking singular
dimensions of the self. In light of this, we offer design implications
for supporting multi-dimensional self-tracking. We propose worker-
centric self-tracking systems to empower gig workers in managing
various accountabilities, prioritizing worker needs and autonomy
in design. Prior research on worker-centered design in the gig
economy discussed incorporating workers’ visions into platform
design [ 91], addressing the multifaceted challenges gig workers face
[62], and democratizing algorithmic design [ 9]. We discuss design
implications related to data collection, analysis, and transparency in
both gig platform-based and third-party tracking systems to reduce
the burden of multi-dimensional accountability management.
Design efforts are needed to explore customizable data collection
methods, allowing gig workers to adapt them to their unique goals,
needs, and interests. This encompasses choosing what to track (i.e.,
income, job details), how to track (i.e., degree of detail), data sources
(i.e., gig platform, third-party app), and acquisition methods (i.e.,
automatic, manual). This customization is particularly relevant to
the three dimensions of the self that gig workers are accountable
to as individuals can tailor their tracking based on their priorities.
For example, someone more curious about understanding platform
dynamics might collect more data related to their performance
accountabilities. Additionally, participants highlighted the use of
multiple tracking tools for various information. Importing and in-
tegrating data from diverse sources can enhance the generation of
comprehensive insights, support informed decision-making, and
address gig workers’ diverse tracking needs, thereby reducing in-
put and analysis efforts. The implementation of comprehensive
integration features can streamline the process, reducing the time
and effort required for gig workers to select and tailor their tools
and data.
Designing for flexible data analysis could also empower indi-
viduals to extract relevant insights from their data based on their
preferences. Participants collected diverse data types including
quantitative measurements (i.e., mileage, time, income), qualitative
notes (i.e., notes on deliveries or clients), and multimedia content
(i.e., map data, photos). Analyzing multiple data types alongside one
another can enhance their ability to interpret their data within its
broader context, easing the effort associated with combining differ-
ent data from various sources. Furthermore, the customizability of
data analysis would enable workers to select what data they analyze
together and how they will be analyzed. Various data visualization
options (i.e., different time frames and visualization types) could ac-
commodate users’ unique needs, interests, and data literacy levels,
Gig Workers’ Self-Tracking for Multi-Dimensional Accountability Management CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
facilitating a deeper understanding of their data and the identifi-
cation of meaningful patterns. The inclusion of more flexible data
analysis features could also enhance support for gig workers as they
navigate the different aspects of their worker identity, as detailed in
this study. By combining relevant data and subsequently highlight-
ing elements most crucial to their needs and interests, this approach
caters to their diverse priorities. Whether they are wellbeing-related
considerations for their holistic self, business-related insights for
their entrepreneurial self, or metric-related observations for their
platformized self, this recommendation addresses the multifaceted
dimensions of their work. Overall, the incorporation of customiz-
able data analysis methods not only reduces the time-consuming
aspects of self-tracking but also facilitates a more nuanced under-
standing of their data, enabling gig workers to identify meaningful
patterns with greater ease.
Finally, offering data transparency could support individuals’
understanding of how their information is handled and used. For
platform metrics, and of relevance to their platformized self, this
entails understanding how and why their metrics are tracked. Our
study participants expressed uncertainty regarding the purpose
and calculation of platform metrics, which affected workers’ ability
to evaluate their performance according to the platforms’ stan-
dards. Furthermore, platforms and third-party tools should also
consider transparency surrounding how they handle (i.e., collect,
store, use) and process (i.e., protect, anonymize) data. The knowl-
edge this transparency would provide can increase worker agency
as they understand the implications of being monitored and em-
power individuals to make informed decisions regarding their data
and interactions with tools that track their activity.
6 Limitations and Future Work
We acknowledge that our study has several limitations. First, the
ongoing debate surrounding the classification of gig workers in the
U.S. [ 14,100] may affect the relevance of our findings if their clas-
sification would change in any way. A shift in classification could
alter gig workers’ accountabilities and their use of self-tracking
tools, as we detailed in section 5.2. Second, our study focused on the
experiences of gig drivers in the U.S., so the findings may not com-
pletely apply to other gig workers (i.e., freelance workers, Airbnb
hosts), and they may also vary depending on the legal responsi-
bilities of workers in different countries. For example, variations
in tax regulations may affect the relevance of the section on tax-
related accountabilities. Future work can explore self-tracking in
other gig work contexts, especially those significantly different
from gig drivers or in other countries. Third, although we made
efforts to diversify our participant pool by recruiting both online
and offline, a portion of our participants found our study through
Reddit, potentially favoring users with a heightened awareness
of gig worker-related accountabilities and self-tracking practices.
Lastly, as our study is qualitative, we encourage further investiga-
tion into gig workers’ self-tracking through alternative research
methods and with larger sample sizes.
7 Conclusion
Our study has revealed how gig workers self-track to effectively
manage the multiple accountabilities associated with their variousidentities. We connect this practice to neoliberalism, highlight-
ing the unpaid self-tracking labor that gig workers undertake to
sustain their employment. While acknowledging self-tracking’s
supportive role, it’s crucial to emphasize its burdensome necessity
for gig workers to thrive and continue working in the gig economy.
Furthermore, we explore how gig workers self-track to address
inherent imbalances in the gig economy which often hinder their
success. This is evident in their struggles with unfair compensation
and the extensive effort required to regain autonomy over their
professional lives, which are managed by self-tracking. Finally,
we propose design considerations for platforms to better support
workers’ multidimensional tracking needs.
Acknowledgments
We extend our sincere appreciation to the anonymous reviewers
whose constructive feedback significantly contributed to the refine-
ment and improvement of our manuscript. Our gratitude extends
